# Archive Notice

## Status: Archived

This project has been archived as of October 21, 2025.

## Reason

The Kuzu graph database repository has been archived by its maintainers as of October 10, 2025. The repository is now read-only with no further updates planned.

**Official Repository**: https://github.com/kuzudb/kuzu

> "This repository was archived by the owner on Oct 10, 2025. It is now read-only."

As Kuzu is no longer actively maintained, this MCP server built around it is also being archived.

## What Was Built

This project successfully implemented a production-ready MCP server for Kuzu with significant features:

### Core Features Implemented
- **Robust Connection Management**: Automatic recovery with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s delays)
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: File-based locking for safe concurrent access from multiple AI agents
- **Dual Transport Support**: Both stdio (Claude Desktop) and HTTP (remote access) modes
- **Web UI**: Complete database management interface with backup/restore capabilities
- **Authentication**: OAuth and Basic Auth support for secure deployments
- **Docker Integration**: Pre-built images and docker-compose workflow
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic handling of Parser/Binder errors and connection failures
- **Query Validation**: MERGE query validation to prevent database crashes
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and monitoring endpoints

### Implementation Status

**Fully Functional** - All planned features completed and tested:
- ✅ Connection recovery and retry logic
- ✅ Multi-agent file-based locking
- ✅ Web UI with authentication
- ✅ OAuth and Basic Auth
- ✅ Docker images and compose files
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Documentation and examples
- ✅ Published to npm and Docker registry
- ✅ Smithery package support

### Technical Achievements

1. **Connection Recovery Architecture** (docs/connection-recovery.md)
   - Process-level error recovery
   - Parser/Binder exception handling
   - Health monitoring with validation queries
   - Exponential backoff retry logic

2. **Multi-Agent Coordination** (docs/Multi-Agent Coordination Design for kuzudb-mcp-server.md)
   - File-based write locks
   - Stale lock detection and cleanup
   - Lock-free read operations
   - Clear error messages for lock conflicts

3. **Kuzu Bug Workarounds** (kuzu-bug-report/KUZU_BUG_WORKAROUNDS.md)
   - DDL timeout handling (`getAll()` hang bug)
   - BigInt serialization fixes
   - MERGE query validation

4. **Production Features**
   - JWT token authentication with configurable expiration
   - Web UI with backup/restore capabilities
   - Docker health checks
   - Comprehensive environment variable configuration

## Future Considerations

For users who were using this server:

### Current Options
1. **Continue using current version**: The server works perfectly with existing Kuzu databases (v1.4.1-r.4)
2. **Fork and maintain**: All source code is MIT licensed and well-documented
3. **Migrate to alternatives**: Consider Neo4j, ArangoDB, or other graph databases with active maintenance

### Alternative Graph Databases
- **Neo4j**: Most popular graph database with extensive tooling
- **ArangoDB**: Multi-model database with graph capabilities
- **MemGraph**: High-performance in-memory graph database
- **TypeDB**: Knowledge graph with type system
- **JanusGraph**: Distributed graph database

## Technical Learnings

### What Worked Exceptionally Well
1. **FastMCP Framework** (`@jordanburke/fastmcp`): Simplified HTTP transport implementation significantly
2. **Connection Recovery Pattern**: Exponential backoff with health validation proved robust
3. **Multi-Agent File Locking**: Simple and effective for local concurrent access
4. **Web UI Integration**: Provided significant value for database management
5. **Docker Containerization**: Made deployment straightforward

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Kuzu `getAll()` hang bug**: Implemented 5-second timeout workaround
2. **BigInt JSON serialization**: Custom replacer for JSON.stringify
3. **MERGE query crashes**: Pre-execution validation with schema caching
4. **Multi-agent coordination**: File-based locks with stale detection
5. **Connection corruption**: Parser/Binder error recovery without restart

### Architecture Patterns Worth Reusing
1. **MCP Server Structure**:
   - `src/server-core.ts` - Database abstraction layer
   - `src/server-fastmcp.ts` - HTTP transport
   - `src/index.ts` - CLI and configuration
   - `src/lock-manager.ts` - Coordination logic

2. **Error Recovery Flow**:
   ```typescript
   Query Request → Health Check
         ↓ (if invalid)
   Discard Connection → Create New → Validate
         ↓
   Retry with Backoff → Return Results
   ```

3. **Web UI Integration**:
   - Separate port (3001) from MCP endpoint (3000)
   - Optional authentication
   - RESTful API design
   - File upload/download handling

### Performance Metrics Achieved
Based on testing with movie database (1000+ nodes):
- Simple queries: < 100ms
- Complex multi-hop: 200-500ms
- Schema retrieval: 100-200ms
- Connection recovery: < 2 seconds

## Repository Preservation
